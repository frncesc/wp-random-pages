# WP Show
### Utility for automatic, unattended viewing of WordPress sites

Demo site: https://projectestac.github.io/wpshow

This project displays a "carousel" of posts and pages from any WordPress site, passing pages automatically at regular intervals of time.

It is intended to be used in kiosk mode, so the content of a website can be displayed to the public.

The selection of pages and posts included on the show can be manually done, based on categories, tags or intervals of time.

This project has been created by ProjectesTAC, the ICT in Education Unit of the Government of Catalonia, and licensed under the terms of the European Union Public Licence (EUPL) v. 1.2

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) is needed to build the main application. Linux users are advised to use the [official LTS repositories](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md).


### Setting up the development environment

First of all, load the required components from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
$ cd path/to/wp-show
$ npm install
```

### Common operations

From here, the most usual operations are:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
